# Go dependency injection

Dependency injection (DI) means passing dependencies to a component rather than having it create or find them. In Go, this is how you build testable, loosely coupled applications — your services declare what they need, and the caller provides it.

## Best Practices Summary

1. Dependencies MUST be injected via constructors — NEVER use global variables or `init()` for service setup
2. Small projects (< 10 services) SHOULD use manual constructor injection — no library needed
3. Interfaces MUST be defined where consumed, not where implemented — accept interfaces, return structs
4. NEVER use global registries or package-level service locators
5. The DI container MUST only exist at the composition root (`main()` or app startup) — NEVER pass the container as a dependency
6. **Prefer lazy initialization** — only create services when first requested
7. **Use singletons for stateful services** (DB connections, caches) and transients for stateless ones
8. **Mock at the interface boundary** — DI makes this trivial
9. **Keep the dependency graph shallow** — deep chains signal design problems

## Why Dependency Injection?

| Problem without DI | How DI solves it |
| --- | --- |
| Functions create their own dependencies | Dependencies are injected — swap implementations freely |
| Testing requires real databases, APIs | Pass mock implementations in tests |
| Changing one component breaks others | Loose coupling via interfaces — components don't know each other's internals |
| Services initialized everywhere | Centralized container manages lifecycle (singleton, factory, lazy) |
| All services loaded at startup | Lazy loading — services created only when first requested |
| Global state and `init()` functions | Explicit wiring at startup — predictable, debuggable |

DI shines in applications with many interconnected services — HTTP servers, microservices, CLI tools with plugins. For a small script with 2-3 functions, manual wiring is fine. Don't over-engineer.

## Manual Constructor Injection (No Library)

For small projects, pass dependencies through constructors.

```go
// Good — explicit dependencies, testable
type UserService struct {
    db     UserStore
    mailer Mailer
    logger *slog.Logger
}

func NewUserService(db UserStore, mailer Mailer, logger *slog.Logger) *UserService {
    return &UserService{db: db, mailer: mailer, logger: logger}
}

// main.go — manual wiring
func main() {
    logger := slog.Default()
    db := postgres.NewUserStore(connStr)
    mailer := smtp.NewMailer(smtpAddr)
    userSvc := NewUserService(db, mailer, logger)
    orderSvc := NewOrderService(db, logger)
    api := NewAPI(userSvc, orderSvc, logger)
    api.ListenAndServe(":8080")
}
```

```go
// Bad — hardcoded dependencies, untestable
type UserService struct {
    db *sql.DB
}

func NewUserService() *UserService {
    db, _ := sql.Open("postgres", os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL")) // hidden dependency
    return &UserService{db: db}
}
```

Manual DI breaks down when:

- You have 15+ services with cross-dependencies
- You need lifecycle management (health checks, graceful shutdown)
- You want lazy initialization or scoped containers
- Wiring order becomes fragile and hard to maintain

## Testing with DI

DI makes testing straightforward — inject mocks instead of real implementations:

```go
// Define a mock
type MockUserStore struct {
    users map[string]*User
}

func (m *MockUserStore) FindByID(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error) {
    u, ok := m.users[id]
    if !ok {
        return nil, ErrNotFound
    }
    return u, nil
}

// Test with manual injection
func TestUserService_GetUser(t *testing.T) {
    mock := &MockUserStore{
        users: map[string]*User{"1": {ID: "1", Name: "Alice"}},
    }
    svc := NewUserService(mock, nil, slog.Default())

    user, err := svc.GetUser(context.Background(), "1")
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatalf("unexpected error: %v", err)
    }
    if user.Name != "Alice" {
        t.Errorf("got %q, want %q", user.Name, "Alice")
    }
}
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Global variables as dependencies | Pass through constructors or DI container |
| `init()` for service setup | Explicit initialization in `main()` or container |
| Depending on concrete types | Accept interfaces at consumption boundaries |
| Passing the container everywhere (service locator) | Inject specific dependencies, not the container |
| Deep dependency chains (A->B->C->D->E) | Flatten — most services should depend on repositories and config directly |
| Creating a new container per request | One container per application; use scopes for request-level isolation |
